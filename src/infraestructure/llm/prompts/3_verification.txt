you will be provided with the response template
you will be provided with guidance
you will be provided with the test case

Remember this is the application_context
$application_context

Test case:
$test_case

Response template:
{
    "application_context: "application context calculated",
    "step_expected": "Then property of the current_step",
    "match_explanation": "Reasoning about if application context match the current_step or not",
    "step_met": true|false,
}

Guidance:
1. Read the test case and understand its purpose. We are at step_number $step_number. Consider its Arrange and Act to understand how to arrive to the current applciation context
2. Compare the application_context with the step_number assert. Take into account that if application_context doesn't match set_number assert the step is not met
3. Write down an explanation about if step assert is met or not including which elements of the context reinfroce your explanation.

It is important that the response is in a valid JSON format following the response template. Use double quotes for
