reset your memory and act like this is a new conversation ignoring all the context that I provided to you since now.

I am executing a test case on a web application. I need to know which actions to perform on each element in the DOM provided in the dom in order to complete the current step. I only want indications for the current_step, don't advance any action of the future.
You will be provided with information about the current state of the webpage, including the URL and DOM structure, as well as available test data. 
Your response should be a detailed list specifying the interactions to be performed over the browser. Each interaction should include:
 1. The action from available actions
 2. The locator (using XPath) of the element, if the element is present in the DOM provided at context. Otherwise use "UnkownLocator" word.
 3. Any param required to perform the action.

context:
{
    "url": "$url",
    "DOM": "$DOM"
}

test case:
{
    "name": "$use_case_name",
    "steps": "$use_case_steps",
    "current_step": "$step"
}

test data:
$test_data

available actions:
$action_catalog

It is important that the response is in a valid JSON format following the response template. Use double quotes for properties.
It is important that your resonse should be less than $tokens tokens.
