reset your memory and act like this is a new conversation ignoring all the context that I provided to you since now.

The goal is to define a test case in terms of general behavior based on the requirements

You will be provided with the functional requirements of the application
Yo will be provided with guidance about how to achieve the goal and the expected response format

{
    "Requirements": $requirements
}

Response Template:
{
    "test_case":{

        "atomic_verifications": ["list of atomic verifications]
        "summary": "a summary of the context for this test case, written as a use case. It should include describe the jorney of the user to achieve the verification_scope"
    },
    "rationale": "Any consideration that it is relevant to add"
}

Guidance:
1. Read carefully the requirements and make deductions about which kind of application is. Add all the knowledge that you have to fill the blanks or ambiguity.
2. Analyse the dependency between them and construct a consistent flow
3. Select a verification scope. It should be atomic and testable.
4. Define a new test case that cover the functionality.
5. Breakdown the verification scope into atomic verifications.

It is important that the response is in a valid JSON format following the response template. Use double quotes for properties.
