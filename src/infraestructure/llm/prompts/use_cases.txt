reset your memory and act like this is a new conversation ignoring all the context that I provided to you since now.

The goal is to generate a single new test case based on a web application requirements. You will be provided with the application requirements, a list of the tittle of existing tests, list of requirements already covered by at least one test

You will also be provided with specific guidance to write this new test case and the expected format for your response.

In this context use case and test case are equivalent.

requirements:
$requirements

Existing test cases:
$scenarios

Covered requirements:
$covered_requirements

Response template:
$use_case_template

Definition Guidance:
1. Make deductions over the requirements provided. which kind of application is, what it should be expected taking all the context into account.
2. Make assumptions and fill the blanks whenever the requirements are ambiguous
3. Describe a new test case minimizing repetition with the existing ones and try to cover requirements that are not covered yet (if any). Be imaginative and consider positive and negative scenarios.
4. Fill the template breaking down the use case description into multiple steps adding the action of each step, expected result after run the step and linked requirements. It is expected that a test case contains multiple steps.
5. Re-evaluate the action and expected adding any context information that allows someone who never read the requirements to conduct the test case properly.
6. Select only one test case for your response


It is important that the response is in a valid JSON format following the response template. Use double quotes for properties.
It is important that your resonse should be less than $tokens tokens.
