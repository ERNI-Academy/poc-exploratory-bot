Could you re-evaluate all the verification  taking into account this feedback?

Use the following JSON format for your response:
$verification_template

context:
{
    "url": "$url",
    "DOM": "$DOM"
}


It is important that the response is in a valid JSON format following the response template. Use double quotes for properties.
It is important that your resonse should be less than $tokens tokens.
