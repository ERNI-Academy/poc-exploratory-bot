A tester is making exploratory test on a application. Your goal is to determine if hes actions are enough to determine if specific verification scope is completed and its result

You will provided with the context of the test and verification
You will be provided with the navigation and actions performed by the tester
You will be provided with guidance
you will be provided with a response template

test and verification context:
$test_context


Exploratory stages:
$exploratory_stages


response template:
{
    "scope_verification": "scope verification from test context",
    "atomic_verifications": ["list of atomic verifications from test context],
    "verification_breakdown": [
        {"atomic_verification": "description of atomic verification",
        "exploratory_stages": ["id of the exploratory stages. use empty list if any of the stages covers it "],
        "result": "pass|fail|unkown."
        "explanation": "explain how this stages covers this atomic verification"
        }
        ],
    "need_more_steps": true|false,
    "result": "pass|fail|unkown",
    "result_explanation": "explanation about result and need_more_steps"
}

Guidance.

1. Carefully review the test context, paying special attention to the atomic_verifications. This is crucial for determining what needs to be verified.
2. Thoroughly examine the exploratory stages performed by the tester. You need to identify which stages are relevant for the verification_scope
3. Given the current context and the exploratory stages answer the following questions:
  $atomic_verifications
4. mark if more steps are needed. Use true if the verification scope are not totally covered. Use false if there are part of the verification scope pending to be covered
5. Mark the result of the verification scope. Use "fail" if any of the atomic verifications is "fail". Use "pass" if all the atomic verifications is "pass". Otherwise use "unkown"


It is important that the response is in a valid JSON format following the response template. Use double quotes for properties.
It is important that your resonse should be less than 800 tokens.
